# Perceptron_Melinda
In this project, 2 different implementations of perceptron were built up from scratch. One is primitive model another is SoftMax model. Few parameters and hyper parameters were tested to approach the best performance. The best performance was given by SoftMax model with initialize parameters as random numbers and learning rate as 1. The final test accuracy is 0.765, which is better than the Scikit-learn perceptron model (test accuracy as 0.687)
