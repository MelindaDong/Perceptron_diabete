# Diabete prediction(perceptron )

In this study, perceptron model was implemented from scratch to predict weather sample individuals have diabetes or not by 8 physical health indicators.

### primitive preceptron
The first model is called the primitive model,  It shows the very first idea of how perceptron works. 


### softmax model 
The Second model is called SoftMax model, it used SoftMax method to predict the probability of one sample have diabetes or not. And used cross entropy to calculate the loss. Gradient descent was implemented from scratch to do optimization.
